# User Profile Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the UserProfile page to transform it into a proper publishing/author page with profile picture, introduction, and editing capabilities. This aligns with Pensive's primary purpose as a publishing platform.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251024000000_add_user_profile_fields.sql`

Added two new fields to the `user_data` table:
- `profile_pic` (TEXT) - URL to user's profile picture
- `intro` (TEXT) - User's introduction/bio text

Updated the `public_user_profiles` view to include these new fields so they're accessible on public profile pages.

### 2. TypeScript Type Definitions
**File:** `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`

Updated the `user_data` table type definitions to include:
- `intro: string | null`
- `profile_pic: string | null`

Added to Row, Insert, and Update types for full type safety.

### 3. New Profile Edit Page
**File:** `src/pages/ProfileEdit.tsx`

Created a comprehensive profile editing interface with:
- Profile picture upload/management
  - Image preview with Avatar component
  - Upload functionality using existing `useSupabaseUpload` hook
  - Remove picture option
- Introduction editor
  - Textarea with 500 character limit
  - Character counter
  - Multi-line support with `whitespace-pre-wrap`
- Username display (read-only)
- Save/Cancel buttons
- Navigation back to profile
- Loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for feedback

**Features:**
- Image compression via `useSupabaseUpload` hook
- Proper authentication check
- Automatic redirect to profile after save
- Responsive design

### 4. Enhanced User Profile Page
**File:** `src/pages/UserProfile.tsx`

Major enhancements to display publishing profile:
- Added profile picture display using Avatar component
- Added introduction/bio section
- Added "Edit Profile" button (only visible to profile owner)
- Improved header layout with profile info and books section
- Better visual hierarchy
- Book count display
- Check for own profile vs viewing others

**New UI Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Avatar]  @username  [Edit Profile]    │
│           Introduction text...          │
│                                         │
│ Published Books                         │
│ X books published                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Book Grid]                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 5. Routing Configuration
**File:** `src/App.tsx`

Added new route:
- `/profile/edit` - Protected route for editing profile
- Wrapped with `PrivateRoute` for authentication
- Imported `ProfileEdit` component

### 6. Documentation Updates
**File:** `PAGES.md`

Updated documentation to reflect:
- Enhanced UserProfile features
- New ProfileEdit page (page #20)
- Updated page statistics (now 20 total pages, 11 private)
- Updated User Profile category count to 3

```

## Database Migration

To apply the schema changes, run:

```bash
# Option 1: Via Supabase CLI (if linked)
supabase db push

# Option 2: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy the contents of the migration file and run in SQL Editor
```

**Migration SQL:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_data
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS profile_pic TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS intro TEXT;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public_user_profiles AS
SELECT
  user_id,
  username,
  email,
  profile_pic,
  intro,
  created_at
FROM user_data
WHERE username IS NOT NULL;

GRANT SELECT ON public_user_profiles TO authenticated, anon;
```

## User Journey

### Viewing a Profile (Public)
1. Navigate to `/:username`
2. See profile picture, intro, and published books
3. No edit button visible (not your profile)

### Editing Your Profile
1. Navigate to `/:username` (your own profile)
2. Click "Edit Profile" button
3. Upload profile picture (or remove existing)
4. Write/edit introduction (up to 500 characters)
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Redirected back to your profile
7. Changes visible immediately

### First-Time Profile Setup
1. New user creates account
2. Sets username via `/set-username`
3. Views their profile at `/:username`
4. Clicks "Edit Profile"
5. Uploads picture and writes intro
6. Now has a complete publishing presence

## Key Features

### Profile Picture
- Stored in Supabase Storage under `profile-pictures/` bucket
- Image compression before upload
- Automatic optimization
- Fallback to initials if no picture

### Introduction
- 500 character limit
- Multi-line support
- Preserves line breaks in display
- Optional (can be left empty)

### Access Control
- Edit button only visible to profile owner
- Profile viewing is public
- Edit page requires authentication
- RLS policies protect user data

### UX Considerations
- Character counter provides feedback
- Loading states during save/upload
- Toast notifications for success/errors
- Cancel button to abort changes
- Avatar fallback shows username initials

## Components Used

- `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, `AvatarFallback` - Profile picture display
- `Button` - Actions and navigation
- `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription` - Layout
- `Input` - File upload
- `Textarea` - Introduction editor

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run database migration
- [ ] Verify profile page displays correctly without profile_pic/intro
- [ ] Upload a profile picture

## Technical Notes

### Image Storage

- Compression applied before upload
- Need to ensure bucket exists and has proper policies

### Database View
- `public_user_profiles` view provides safe public access
- Only exposes necessary fields
- Automatically filters users with usernames
- Granted to both authenticated and anonymous users

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript support
- Database types auto-generated
- Type checking prevents errors

### Performance
- Images lazy-loaded
- Avatar component optimized
- Database queries use indexes
- View reduces query complexity
